This project uses a variety of APIs from the google cloud platform. We are using the gspread and google auth libraries to access our google sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tw2SX4CEhTe-73U9Lv_Fyw3-vyfEaaLXzJDSxz8v9Bw/edit?usp=sharing to view and edit data. 
On the google cloud platform we start by creating a new project and installing our previously mentioned libraries, once we have these enabled we can create a credentials file, creds.json. We also receive a service account email that we can share our sheet with so that we have access to it from within our application.
